### Commentary

This is a large retrospective observational study. A cohort of 960 Medicare beneficiary patients aged >65 admitted to hospital with sepsis were retrospectively matched to three comparison groups: 777 adults not currently in hospital, 788 patients admitted with non-sepsis infection, and 504 patients admitted with acute sterile inflammatory conditions. 

The primary outcome was mortality, and Kaplan-Meyer survival curves were generated for the sepsis and matched comparison cohorts. Sepsis was associated with increased mortality compared with all 3 control groups (P<0.001 for each comparison). In particular, compared to adults not in hospital, this increased mortality persists for up to 2 years. The greatest increase in mortality was within the first 90 days from the initial sepsis insult. 

One limitation of this study is that this is an observational study, and there were unmatched patients omitted from analysis and missing information from the surveys that were imputed with multiple imputation. There was also no differentiation between patients for severity of sepsis nor intensity of treatment. Further research is needed to delineate and understand the mechanisms for mortality after sepsis.
