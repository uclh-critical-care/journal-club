Welcome to the wiki for the Critical Care Journal Club at UCLH.

The short plan is to stop adding to the graveyard of powerpoint presentations on a shared drive, and create a living document that will remain relevant and useful.

We are encouraging trainees to create a single mini-web page in place of a presentation. You then present your web page.

The ambition is that people might start to come here as a useful revision resource.

The site is run by linking a Trello board to a Jekyll blog hosted (for now) at GitHub. You can see the script, and contribute(!) at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/uclh-critical-care/journal-club).
