This repository has been created mainly to use [issue tracker](https://github.com/uclh-critical-care/journal-club/issues) and the [wiki](https://github.com/uclh-critical-care/journal-club/wiki) functionality for managing the journal club.

There aren't meant to be any files in the repo itself for now so just click [here](https://github.com/uclh-critical-care/journal-club/wiki) or in the _wiki_ link in the link list above.

The results from the joural club will be published on the UCLH Critical Care website (under development).
