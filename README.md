This repository has been created mainly to use the wiki functionality.

There aren't meant to be any files in the repo itself for now so just click [here](https://github.com/uclh-critical-care/journal-club/wiki) or in the _wiki_ link in the link list above.

One logical next step would be to convert this repository into an intranet. Another is to use this wiki as the basis for a fully functional [gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/) wiki (but hosted separately).
