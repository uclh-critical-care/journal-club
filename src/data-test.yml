abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Long-term complications of critical illness include intensive
  care unit (ICU)-acquired weakness and neuropsychiatric disease. Immobilisation secondary
  to sedation might potentiate these problems. We assessed the efficacy of combining
  daily interruption of sedation with physical and occupational therapy on functional
  outcomes in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in intensive care. METHODS:
  Sedated adults (>/=18 years of age) in the ICU who had been on mechanical ventilation
  for less than 72 h, were expected to continue for at least 24 h, and who met criteria
  for baseline functional independence were eligible for enrolment in this randomised
  controlled trial at two university hospitals. We randomly assigned 104 patients
  by computer-generated, permuted block randomisation to early exercise and mobilisation
  (physical and occupational therapy) during periods of daily interruption of sedation
  (intervention; n=49) or to daily interruption of sedation with therapy as ordered
  by the primary care team (control; n=55). The primary endpoint-the number of patients
  returning to independent functional status at hospital discharge-was defined as
  the ability to perform six activities of daily living and the ability to walk independently.
  Therapists who undertook patient assessments were blinded to treatment assignment.
  Secondary endpoints included duration of delirium and ventilator-free days during
  the first 28 days of hospital stay. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial
  is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00322010. FINDINGS: All 104 patients
  were included in the analysis. Return to independent functional status at hospital
  discharge occurred in 29 (59%) patients in the intervention group compared with
  19 (35%) patients in the control group (p=0.02; odds ratio 2.7 [95% CI 1.2-6.1]).
  Patients in the intervention group had shorter duration of delirium (median 2.0
  days, IQR 0.0-6.0 vs 4.0 days, 2.0-8.0; p=0.02), and more ventilator-free days (23.5
  days, 7.4-25.6 vs 21.1 days, 0.0-23.8; p=0.05) during the 28-day follow-up period
  than did controls. There was one serious adverse event in 498 therapy sessions (desaturation
  less than 80%). Discontinuation of therapy as a result of patient instability occurred
  in 19 (4%) of all sessions, most commonly for perceived patient-ventilator asynchrony.
  INTERPRETATION: A strategy for whole-body rehabilitation-consisting of interruption
  of sedation and physical and occupational therapy in the earliest days of critical
  illness-was safe and well tolerated, and resulted in better functional outcomes
  at hospital discharge, a shorter duration of delirium, and more ventilator-free
  days compared with standard care. FUNDING: None.'

review: '## Summary


  Delirium in sedated, mechanically ventilated ICU patients is common and associated
  with increased morbidity. Critical illness neuromypoathy is common and is associated
  with increased utilisation of healthcare resources. This study aimed to assess the
  effect of daily sedation holds and early exercise on the time taken to return to
  independent functional status at hospital discharge, in general ICU adult patients
  with baseline functional independence. Early exercise and mobilization with daily
  sedation hold was compaired to standard care of daily sedation hold but no physiotherapy
  until extubation. The primary outcome was return to independent functional status
  at hospital discharge


  The treatment and control arms were well matched for demographics and had a similar
  survival rate. The proportion of patients being discharged with independent functional
  outcomes was significantly greater in the treatment arm compared to the control
  arm (59% vs 35%; p=0.02). There was no difference in hospital length of stay although
  reduction in ICU by 2 days; (p=0.08 for ICU LoS). There was significantly decreased
  number of days with delirium among the treatment arm compared to the control arm
  (2 days vs. 4 days; p=0.03). There were better discharge rates home (p=0.06) than
  to care facilities among the treatment arm. The study concluded the intervention
  was feasible and relatively safe.


  ## Comment


  **This appears to be a cost-effective intervention. However, the results are only
  applicable to a small subset of ICU patients who were previously well. It is unclear
  if the patient demographics locally would justify such an intervention.**


  The benefits on patients with previous dependence on ADLs is not clear. There was
  no difference in MRC strength but faster regain of ADLS. This suggests that the
  intervention may have taught patients how to adapt rather than improving physical
  ability. It is also unclear if this data can be extrapolated to UK with a different
  health and social care system


  A decrease in ventilator days was noted in treatment arm. However it was among the
  non- survivors only. In other words, does the intervention alter illness trajectory
  among patients with a poor prognosis? This result is difficult to interpret and
  may be a chance finding, particularly with a relatively small patient cohort.'
