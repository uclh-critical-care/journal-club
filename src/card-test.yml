  Delirium in sedated, mechanically ventilated ICU patients is common and associated
  with increased morbidity. Critical illness neuromypoathy is common and is associated
  with increased utilisation of healthcare resources. This study aimed to assess the
  effect of daily sedation holds and early exercise on the time taken to return to
  independent functional status at hospital discharge, in general ICU adult patients
  with baseline functional independence. Early exercise and mobilization with daily
  sedation hold was compaired to standard care of daily sedation hold but no physiotherapy
  until extubation. The primary outcome was return to independent functional status
  at hospital discharge


  The treatment and control arms were well matched for demographics and had a similar
  survival rate. The proportion of patients being discharged with independent functional
  outcomes was significantly greater in the treatment arm compared to the control
  arm (59% vs 35%; p=0.02). There was no difference in hospital length of stay although
  reduction in ICU by 2 days; (p=0.08 for ICU LoS). There was significantly decreased
  number of days with delirium among the treatment arm compared to the control arm
  (2 days vs. 4 days; p=0.03). There were better discharge rates home (p=0.06) than
  to care facilities among the treatment arm. The study concluded the intervention
  was feasible and relatively safe.


  ## Comment


  **This appears to be a cost-effective intervention. However, the results are only
  applicable to a small subset of ICU patients who were previously well. It is unclear
  if the patient demographics locally would justify such an intervention.**


  The benefits on patients with previous dependence on ADLs is not clear. There was
  no difference in MRC strength but faster regain of ADLS. This suggests that the
  intervention may have taught patients how to adapt rather than improving physical
  ability. It is also unclear if this data can be extrapolated to UK with a different
  health and social care system


  A decrease in ventilator days was noted in treatment arm. However it was among the
  non- survivors only. In other words, does the intervention alter illness trajectory
  among patients with a poor prognosis? This result is difficult to interpret and
  may be a chance finding, particularly with a relatively small patient cohort.'
